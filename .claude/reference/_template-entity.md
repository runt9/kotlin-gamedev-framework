# Human Readable Name

> **Incomplete and permanently WIP.** These notes record what has been investigated, not what exists. Anything not mentioned here is almost certainly "not looked at yet" rather than "not there" or "not a problem". REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with one or two naming what *this* note does not cover — for a play note that means the evidence that is missing (which characters, difficulties, rounds), not the code that was not read.

One paragraph on what this entity is and why it has a note. An entity note earns its
place by holding something a catalog does not: how the thing is actually used, judged,
or reasoned about — not a restatement of what it mechanically does.

## Observations

- [fact] A single indexable fact, citing `symbolName` plus `TheFile.ext:123`.
- [decision] A choice made deliberately about this entity, with the reasoning.
- [question] Genuinely open. Say what would answer it.

## Relations

- part_of [[The Index Note For This Kind]]
- see_also [[Another Entity]]

<!--
CHECKLIST — delete this block before saving.

  [ ] Is this actually an entity? One note per member of an ENUMERABLE set (an
      item, a recording, a character). If the set is "however many investigations
      we do", it is a topic and belongs in domains/ instead.
  [ ] permalink = the path under .claude/reference/, minus .md. Unlike domains/,
      the leading directory is KEPT: entities/<kind>/<slug>.
  [ ] REQUIRED: title, type, permalink, tags, verified, coverage, and the banner.
      OPTIONAL: branch, sources, id — delete the ones that do not apply rather
      than leaving them blank.
  [ ] tags carry what would otherwise be structured metadata: the kind (sticker,
      trinket, recording) and any classification (rarity, character). This is
      deliberate — a per-kind frontmatter key would be forced onto every note in
      the tree, including the ones it makes no sense for.
  [ ] sources = files whose change would make something here WRONG. For an item,
      the definition that implements it. Omit for a recording: its evidence is a
      video that is deliberately disposable, and requiring it would break the KB
      once frames are cleaned up.
  [ ] id is for a stable external identifier. Recording ids (v1, v2, …) are
      IMMUTABLE — they are the citation token in ~180 inline provenance markers,
      so renumbering is a corpus-wide rewrite, not a rename.
  [ ] Relations declare part_of the index note for this kind. The index lives in
      domains/, and _validate.py enforces the backlink, so an entity note that is
      not indexed will warn.
  [ ] Play notes mark claims [observed] / [stated] / [derived] inline in prose —
      see "RogueFlip-specific conventions" in README.md. Do not convert those into
      observation categories or tags.
  [ ] Title matches the [[wikilinks]] other notes will use to reach it, and is
      unique across the whole KB.
